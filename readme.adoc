= Spigot Block Compression Plugin
:toc:

**FOR THE HOARD!**

A small plugin for SpigotMC that allows players to "compress" and "decompress"
stacks of items or blocks for easier storage or transport of mass quantities.

9 of any of the configured allowable items/blocks may be compressed into a
single item/block.  This process may be repeated to compress a stack up to 9
times to store a maximum of 24,794,911,296 items in a full (64) stack of fully
compressed items.

== Configuration

Block interaction to open the compression workbench can be configured with the
plugin's `config.yml` file:

.plugin.yml
[source, yaml]
----
# Configures whether/how players can open the compression workbench by
# interacting with a block, while optionally holding a "key" item to enable the
# interaction.
#
# For example, if set to `target: minecraft:fletching_table` and
# `holding: minecraft:diamond` then players with the correct permissions will be
# able to open the crafting workbench by right clicking a diamond against a
# fletching table.
open-on-interact:
  # Whether opening the crafting workbench by interacting with a block is
  # enabled.
  #
  # Values: true|false
  enabled: true
  # ID of the target block that must be interacted with (right clicked on) to
  # open the crafting workbench.
  #
  # Values: <any valid block id>
  target: minecraft:fletching_table
  # ID of the item that must be held by the player when interacting with
  # (right clicking) the target block.
  #
  # To disable an item requirement, set to `minecraft:air`.
  #
  # Values: <any valid item id>
  holding: minecraft:diamond
----

Additionally the plugin reads what blocks are allowed to be (de)compressed from 2 files:
https://github.com/Foxcapades/Spigot-Compression-Plugin/blob/main/src/main/resources/compressible-items.txt[`compressible-items.txt`]
and https://github.com/Foxcapades/Spigot-Compression-Plugin/blob/main/src/main/resources/compressible-blocks.txt[`compressible-blocks.txt`].

These files will be created in the plugin's config directory on first load.

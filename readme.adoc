= Spigot Block Compression Plugin

**FOR THE HOARD!**

A small plugin for SpigotMC that allows players to "compress" and "decompress"
stacks of items or blocks for easier storage or transport of mass quantities.

9 of any of the configured allowable items/blocks may be compressed into a
single item/block.  This process may be repeated to compress a stack up to 9
times to store a maximum of 24,794,911,296 items in a full (64) stack of fully
compressed items.

== Configuration

The plugin reads what blocks are allowed to be (de)compressed from 2 files:
https://github.com/Foxcapades/Spigot-Compression-Plugin/blob/main/src/main/resources/compressible-items.txt[`compressible-items.txt`]
and https://github.com/Foxcapades/Spigot-Compression-Plugin/blob/main/src/main/resources/compressible-blocks.txt[`compressible-blocks.txt`].

These files will be created in the plugin's config directory on first load.
